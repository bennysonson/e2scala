# E2SCALA

ESCALA is a networking platform for Latin American students, aimed to increase collaboration opportunities for Latin American students both in the US and in Latin America. This project was started by a senior design group in Spring 2022. I worked on the phase 2 implementation with a senior design team in Fall 2022. Our job was to continue working on functionality so that the platform would be ready for launch.

The requirements of phase 2 were focused on increasing community engagement and accessiblity through several new features:
- Listserv support
- Multilingual support
- View member distribution by map
- View member distribution by working group
- Displayable Twitter Feed
- Filter and search members

The project was created using WordPress, a plugin-based management framework to help with implementation. WordPress provides several third-party plugins to help with implementation, but for requirements that cannot be fulfilled with plugins, we wrote custom plugins to satisfy requirements.
